Description: Nowadays, the way to create a co-expression network is to use Hierarchical Clustering. 
      This package allows you to create a co-expression network using the glmnet algorithm. 
      In addition, the network created will be relative to a covariate of the sample to be studied,
      so we are creating a supervised coexpression network.
